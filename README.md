# expenses_tracker
this will be a simple project in the beginning but it'll be scalable. This is an expense tracker, with this program you can register your expenses and order them by different criterias, also you'll be able to visualize your data for an easier comprehension.
at the moment i am using only pandas and os and I will add some validations in utils soon!
